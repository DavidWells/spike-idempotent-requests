# Idempotent Requests Demo Application PRD

## 1. Core Functionality & Purpose
The application demonstrates and implements idempotent request handling, ensuring that duplicate requests are handled safely and efficiently. This is particularly important for operations that should only be executed once, such as payments, order processing, or resource creation.

## 2. Key Technical Goals & Scope
### In Scope
- Implementation of server-side idempotency using AWS Lambda Powertools
- Client-side idempotency handling with request caching
- DynamoDB-based persistence layer for idempotency tracking
- Simple React frontend for demonstrating the functionality

### Out of Scope
- Complex business logic beyond idempotency demonstration
- Production-grade security measures
- Advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Complex UI/UX features

## 3. User Interaction & Technical Design
### Primary User Type
- Developers and technical users testing idempotency patterns
- API consumers integrating with the demo endpoints

### Interaction Methods
- REST API endpoints with idempotency key headers
- Simple web interface for testing idempotent requests
- Direct API access for integration testing

## 4. Essential Features & Implementation Details
### Backend Features
- AWS Lambda Powertools integration for idempotency
- DynamoDB persistence layer for request tracking
- 24-hour expiration for idempotency records
- UUID-based idempotency key generation

### Frontend Features
- Client-side request caching using localStorage
- Request hash generation for duplicate detection
- Automatic idempotency key generation
- Offline support for previously successful operations

## 5. Acceptance Criteria & "Done" Definition
- Backend successfully identifies and handles duplicate requests
- Frontend correctly caches and reuses successful responses
- DynamoDB table properly tracks idempotency state
- System maintains consistency across retries and duplicates
- Basic error handling for failed requests
- Documentation of implementation patterns

## 6. Key Technical Requirements & Constraints
### Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js 22 with Serverless Framework
- Frontend: React with Vite
- Database: AWS DynamoDB
- Infrastructure: AWS Lambda

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time < 500ms for cached requests
- 24-hour idempotency window
- Basic error handling and logging
- Simple and maintainable codebase

## 7. Success Metrics (Technical Viewpoint)
- Successful handling of duplicate requests
- Correct caching and reuse of responses
- Proper cleanup of expired idempotency records
- Minimal latency for cached responses
- Zero data inconsistency in duplicate scenarios

## 8. Development Logistics & Lookahead
### Technical Risks
- Race conditions in concurrent requests
- Storage limitations in client-side caching
- DynamoDB cost implications for high traffic

### Future Considerations
- Migration to IndexedDB for larger response caching
- Implementation of more sophisticated hashing algorithms
- Addition of automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Enhanced offline synchronization capabilities
- Production-grade security measures
